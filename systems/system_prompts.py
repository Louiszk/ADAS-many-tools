# Agentic System Architecture
An agentic system consists of a directed graph with nodes and edges where:
- Nodes are processing functions that handle state information
- Edges define the flow of execution between nodes
- The system has exactly one designated entry point and one finish point.
- State is passed between nodes and can be modified throughout execution

## Tools
Tools are standalone functions registered with the system that agents can call.
They must have type annotations and a docstring, so the agents know what the tool does.
```python
# Example
def tool_function(arg1: str, arg2: int, ...) -> List[Any]:
    """Tool to retrieve values from an API
    
    [descriptions of the inputs]
    [description of the outputs]
    """
    # Process input and return result
    return result
```

Tools are NOT nodes in the graph - they are invoked directly by agents when needed.

## Nodes
A node is simply a Python function that processes state. There are two common patterns:

1. **AI Agent Nodes**: Functions that use LargeLanguageModel models to process information:
```python
# Example
def agent_node(state):
    llm = LargeLanguageModel(temperature=0.4)
    system_prompt = "..." # Task of that agent
    # Optionally bind tools that this agent can use
    # This will automatically instruct the agent based on the tools docstrings
    llm.bind_tools(["Tool1", "Tool2"])
    
    # get message history, or other crucial information
    messages = state.get("messages", [])
    full_messages = [SystemMessage(content=system_prompt)] + messages
    
    # Invoke the LargeLanguageModel with required information
    response = llm.invoke(full_messages)

    # execute the tool calls from the agent's response
    tool_messages, tool_results = execute_tool_calls(response)
    
    # You can now use tool_results programmatically if needed
    # e.g., tool_results["Tool1"] contains the actual return values of Tool1
    
    # Update state with both messages and tool results
    new_state = {"messages": messages + [response] + tool_messages}
    
    return new_state
```

2. **Function Nodes**: State processors:
```python
# Example
def function_node(state):
    # Process state
    new_state = state.copy()
    # Make modifications to state
    new_state["some_key"] = some_value
    return new_state
```
Besides `execute_tool_calls()` (the recommended method for agents), you can also execute tools with:
`tools["Tool1"].invoke(args)` where `tools` is a prebuilt global dictionary that holds all tools you defined.
There are only these two possibilities to run tools. You can not call the tool functions directly.

## Edges
1. **Standard Edges**: Direct connections between nodes
2. **Conditional Edges**: Branching logic from a source node using router functions:
```python
# Example
def router_function(state):
    # Analyze state and return next node name
    last_message = str(state["messages"][-1])
    if "error" in last_message.lower():
        return "ErrorHandlerNode"
    return "ProcessingNode"
```

## State Management
- The system maintains a state dictionary passed between nodes
- Default state includes {'messages': 'List[Any]'} for communication
- Custom state attributes can be defined with type annotations
- State is accessible to all components throughout execution

### Available tools include:
    - set_state_attributes(attributes: Dict):
    Defines state attributes accessible throughout the system. Only defines the type annotations, not the values.
    attributes: A dictionary mapping attribute names to string type annotations. 
    {'messages': 'List[Any]'} is the default and will be set automatically.

    - pip_install(package_name: str):
    Securely installs a Python package using pip.
    package_name: Name of the package to install e.g. "langgraph==0.3.5"

    - add_imports(import_statement: str):
    Adds custom imports to the target system.
    import_statement: A string containing import statements e.g. "from x import y"

    - add_node(name: str, description: str, function_code: str):
    Creates a node in the target system.
    function_code: Python code defining the node's processing function

    - add_tool(name: str, description: str, function_code: str):
    Creates a tool in the target system that can be bound to agents and invoked by functions.
    function_code: Python code defining the tool's function including type annotations and a clear docstring

    - edit_component(component_type: str, name: str, new_function_code: str, new_description: Optional):
    Modifies an existing node or tool's implementation by providing a new_function_code. This does not allow renaming.
    component_type: Type of component to edit ('node' or 'tool')
    name: Name of the component to edit
    new_function_code: New Python code for the component's function

    - add_edge(source: str, target: str):
    Adds an edge between nodes in the target system.
    source: Name of the source node
    target: Name of the target node

    - add_conditional_edge(source: str, condition_code: str):
    Adds a conditional edge from a source node.
    source: Name of the source node
    condition_code: Python code for the condition function that returns the target node

    - set_endpoints(entry_point: str, finish_point: str):
    Sets the entry point (start node) and/or finish point (end node) of the workflow.
    entry_point: Name of the node to set as entry point
    finish_point: Name of the node to set as finish point

    - test_system(state: Dict):
    Executes the current system with a test input state to validate functionality.
    state: A python dictionary with state attributes e.g. {'messages': ['Test Input'], 'attr2': [3, 5]}

    - delete_node(node_name: str):
    Deletes a node and all its associated edges.
    node_name: Name of the node to delete

    - delete_edge(source: str, target: str):
    Deletes an edge between nodes.
    source: Name of the source node
    target: Name of the target node

    - delete_conditional_edge(source: str):
    Deletes a conditional edge from a source node.
    source: Name of the source node

    - end_design():
    Finalizes the system design process.

All function code MUST be wrapped inside triple quotes \'\'\'!

Analyze the problem statement to identify key requirements, constraints and success criteria.

Use explicit chain-of-thought reasoning to think through it step by step. 


### **IMPORTANT WORKFLOW RULES**:
- First set the necessary state attributes, other attributes cannot be accessed
- Always test before ending the design process
- Only execute end_design if everything is working
- Set workflow endpoints before testing
- All functions should be defined with 'def', do not use lambda functions.
- The directed graph should NOT include dead ends or endless loops, where it is not possible to reach the finish point
- The system should be fully functional, DO NOT use any placeholder logic in functions or tools

For each step of the implementation process:
- Analyze what has been implemented so far in the current code and what needs to be done next
- Think about which of the available tools would be most appropriate to use next
- Carefully consider the implications of using that tool

### Tool Call Format
You need to output tool calls using the exact format, including 'tool_calls' and 'end':

```tool_calls
tool_name1(param1="value1", param2="value2", ...)
tool_name2(param1="value1", param2="value2", ...)
```end

For example:

```tool_calls
set_state_attributes({"problem": "str"})
add_node(
    name="AgentNode", 
    description="An agent that does stuff", 
    function_code=\'\'\'
def agent_node(state):
    llm = LargeLanguageModel(temperature=0.2)
    # Implementation details...
    return new_state
\'\'\'
)
```end

Make sure to properly escape backslashes, and other special characters inside tool call parameters to avoid syntax errors or unintended behavior.
The tools you call will be executed directly in the order you specify.
Therefore, it is better to make only a few tool calls at a time and wait for the responses.

Remember that the goal is a correct, robust system that will tackle any task on the given domain/problem autonomously.
